# hello-world
Baby's first repository

What's shakin GitHub??

My name is DJ Walker. I'm an aspiring web developer and designer with a burning
interest in all areas of front-end development, e.g. UX, responsive design, etc.

HTML, CSS, and Javascript are my bread and butter right now, and I intend to be
proficient at Bootstrap, React, and mobile development within 3-5 months.

Yes, I'm new to this, but I have big dreams. I'm a tech tadpole vying to grow into a bona fide web dev bullfrog.

Let's collab!!
